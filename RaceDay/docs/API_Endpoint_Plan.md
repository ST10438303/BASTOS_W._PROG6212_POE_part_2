# RaceDay – API Endpoint Plan

This document lists every API endpoint the RaceDay system exposes, as planned in Part 1 and implemented in Part 2. It covers Authentication, User Profile, Events, Categories, Event Enrolments, and Results.

> **Note on deviations (Part 2):** Events now also capture `Distance` and `EventType` (Run/Walk/Cycle), and Categories now support age-based entries via `MinAge`/`MaxAge` in addition to `DistanceKm`. These were required by Part 2's functional requirements but were not in the original Part 1 ERD. See `README.md` for the full explanation. The endpoints below have been updated accordingly; no endpoint routes changed.

Roles: **None** = public/no login required · **Any** = any logged-in user · **Organiser** / **Participant** = restricted to that role.
